SwitchedHit is a web and mobile-based T20 cricket simulation platform that enables users to create, manage, and compete with teams within a structured multi-season league system featuring promotion and relegation mechanics based on performance. 

Users can register or log in, choose a team name and home ground, receive a squad of 15 auto-generated players, and strategically set their playing XI, batting order, and bowling lineup. 

The platform incorporates dynamic training sessions that enhance player performance over time and allows users to customize their home grounds to exploit strategic advantages such as spin-friendly, pace-friendly, or flat pitches. 

Matches are scheduled automatically at specific times of the day, with simulated results generated and displayed to users. 

Admins can create leagues, manage teams, configure match lineups, view and test simulations, and adjust core parameters to validate score generation accuracy. 

The application is built with Next.js 13, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI, powered by Prisma ORM with a local SQLite database integrated directly into the app for seamless and efficient data management.
