## Critical Missing Pieces

### üéâ **Blocker Issues** - ALL RESOLVED! ‚úÖ
1. ~~**User Authentication**~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (NextAuth.js with bcrypt, JWT sessions, role-based access)
2. ~~**Team Creation Forms**~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (User and admin forms with validation)
3. ~~**Player Auto-Generation**~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (15-player balanced squads with skills)
4. ~~**Player Skill System**~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (battingSkill & bowlingSkill 0-100 range)
5. ~~**Match Creation Forms**~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (Admin match scheduling form with validation)
6. ~~**Simulation Integration**~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (Full integration with database persistence)
7. ~~**Match Detail Pages**~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (Comprehensive match view with commentary)
8. ~~**Ball-by-Ball Display**~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (Tabular commentary with all ball details)

**üöÄ The app is now fully functional for core match simulation workflow!**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **High Priority** (Enhanced gameplay features)
1. **Manual Playing XI Selection** - Currently auto-selects top 11 by skills (works but not customizable)
2. **Automatic Time-based Scheduling** - Matches need to trigger at specific times
3. **Player CRUD Forms** - Need manual player creation/editing
4. **Team Editing** - Can create but not edit teams
5. **Match Editing** - Can create but not edit matches

### üìã **Medium Priority** (Enhanced features)
1. **Home Ground Customization** - Strategic depth
2. **Training System** - Player progression
3. **League Structure** - Multi-team competition
4. **Season Tracking** - Long-term progression
5. **Statistics Dashboard** - Player/team performance tracking

### üéØ **Nice to Have** (Future enhancements)
1. **Promotion/Relegation** - Advanced league mechanics
2. **Mobile Optimization** - Mobile app features
3. **Real-time Updates** - Live match updates
4. **Notifications** - Match start/result notifications
5. **Social Features** - Player interaction

4. ~~**Form Validation**~~: ‚úÖ Basic validation implemented (could enhance with Zod)
5. ~~**API Routes**~~: ‚úÖ API endpoints created for auth and teams (need more for players/matches)
6. **Testing**: No tests (unit, integration, or e2e)
7. **Type Safety**: Could improve with Zod schemas for runtime validation
8. **Code Duplication**: Some repeated patterns in page components
9. **Password Reset**: No forgot password / reset password flow
10. **Email Verification**: No email verification for new accounts
11. ~~**Player Skills**~~: Batting & bowling skill ratings stored on Player model
