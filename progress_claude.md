5. **Ball-by-Ball Display** - Show simulation commentary

### 📋 **Medium Priority** (Enhanced features)
1. **Home Ground Customization** - Strategic depth
2. **Training System** - Player progression
3. **League Structure** - Multi-team competition
4. **Season Tracking** - Long-term progression
5. **Statistics Dashboard** - Player/team performance tracking

### 🎯 **Nice to Have** (Future enhancements)

- ✅ **Team detail pages** with full roster display
- ✅ **Match listing** (scheduled/completed separation)
- ✅ **Cricket simulation engine** (ready, not integrated)
- ⚠️ **Pending git commit** (latest changes in working directory)
- ❌ No match creation forms
- ❌ No match simulation integration
- ❌ No gameplay mechanics (Playing XI, lineup config)

**To Reach MVP:** 
- ~~Authentication~~ ✅ **DONE**
- ~~Team creation~~ ✅ **DONE** 
- ~~Player auto-generation (15 per team)~~ ✅ **DONE**
- ~~Player skill system~~ ✅ **DONE**
- **Match creation forms** (admin/user)
- **Simulation integration with UI**
- **Match detail pages with simulation trigger**
- **Ball-by-ball commentary display**

**To Match Project Description:** 
- Playing XI selection interface
- Automatic match scheduling system
- Training system for player progression
- League and season structure
- Promotion/relegation mechanics
- Home ground customization with pitch types

**Estimated Completion:** 
- **MVP**: 1-2 weeks (core foundation complete, need match/simulation integration)
- **Full Feature Set**: 5-7 weeks (reduced from 6-8 due to completed player system)

**Major Achievements:** 
1. **Authentication System** - Production-ready with password hashing, JWT sessions, role-based access control, and protected routes
2. **Player Generation System** - Sophisticated automatic squad generation with balanced roles and skill distributions
3. **Data Integrity** - Transaction-based operations ensure atomic creation of teams with players
4. **Simulation Engine** - Complete T20 cricket simulation logic ready for integration

**Next Critical Steps:**
1. Commit pending changes to git (player skills, generator, API updates)
2. Create match creation forms (admin + user)
3. Build match detail pages with simulation trigger button
4. Integrate simulation engine with database (save Innings and Ball records)
5. Display ball-by-ball commentary on match detail pages

## 🎯 Immediate Action Items

### 1. Commit Current Work (5 minutes)
The player skill system and generator are complete but uncommitted. These should be saved to version control.

### 2. Match Management System (2-3 days)
- Create `/admin/matches/create` page with form
- Build API route `POST /api/matches` for match creation
- Implement `/matches/[id]` detail page
- Add "Simulate Match" button on detail page

### 3. Simulation Integration (1-2 days)
- Create API route `POST /api/matches/[id]/simulate`
- Use existing `CricketSimulator` class
- Save Innings and Ball records to database
- Return simulation results

### 4. Ball-by-Ball Display (1 day)
- Design commentary UI component
- Display simulation results on match detail page
- Show innings scores, wickets, overs
- List key moments (boundaries, wickets)

### 5. Playing XI Selection (2-3 days)
- Create MatchLineup model
- Build lineup selection UI (drag-drop or numbered list)
- Save batting order and bowling rotation
- Use lineup in simulation

**Total Estimated Time to MVP:** 1-2 weeks
