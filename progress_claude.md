2. ✅ Admin schedules matches between teams
3. ✅ Admin triggers match simulation
4. ✅ System runs full T20 simulation with toss, batting orders
5. ✅ Ball-by-ball commentary saved to database
6. ✅ Complete match results displayed with scoreboard

## 🚀 Quick Start Workflow

### For Users:
1. Register account (`/auth/register`)
2. Login (`/auth/login`)
3. Create team (`/teams/create`) → 15 players auto-generated
4. View team roster (`/teams/[id]`)

### For Admins:
1. All user features +
2. Schedule match (`/admin/matches/create`)
3. View match (`/matches/[id]`)
