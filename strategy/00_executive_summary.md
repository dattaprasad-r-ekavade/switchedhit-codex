---

## Critical Success Factors

### Must-Haves (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Mobile App by Month 9-12**: India is mobile-first; without app, lose 60%+ of market
2. **Community Building**: Discord, tournaments, content - creates defensible moat
3. **Ethical Monetisation**: Maintain no P2W; long-term trust > short-term revenue
4. **Quality Simulation**: Must feel realistic; bugs/imbalance kill credibility
5. **Fast Iteration**: Ship features biweekly; stay ahead of copycats

### Nice-to-Haves (Accelerators)

6. Licensed content (official teams/players)
7. Celebrity endorsements (cricketers)
8. Regional language support (Year 2)
9. Esports infrastructure (Year 2-3)
10. International expansion (Year 3+)

---

## Competitive Moats (Long-Term Defensibility)

1. **Community**: Engaged Discord/Reddit users = hard to replicate
2. **Network Effects**: More users ‚Üí better matchmaking ‚Üí more engagement
3. **Content Library**: 100+ cosmetics, stadiums (takes time to build)
4. **Brand**: "The ethical cricket simulation" positioning
5. **Data**: User behavior insights improve simulation quality over time

**Weakest Moat**: Technology (can be copied)  
**Strongest Moat**: Community + Brand (trust-based)

---

## Path to ‚Çπ100 Crore (5-Year Vision)

### Required Milestones

| Year | Users | Revenue (‚ÇπCr) | Key Unlock |
|------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | 10K | 0.9 | Product-market fit |
| 2 | 50K | 3.3 | Mobile app launch |
| 3 | 200K | 13.4 | Profitability at scale |
| 4 | 600K | 35-40 | South Asian expansion |
| 5 | 1.5M | 80-100 | Market leader, esports |

**Critical Path**:
1. Validate in India (Year 1-2)
2. Launch mobile apps (Year 2)
3. Dominate niche (Year 3)
4. Expand regionally (Year 4)
5. Scale + partnerships (Year 5)

---

## Key Decisions & Trade-offs

### Decision 1: Bootstrap vs Raise Early
**Recommendation**: Bootstrap Year 1, raise seed after validation  
**Rationale**: Proves unit economics, higher valuation, better investor terms

### Decision 2: Web-First vs Mobile-First
**Recommendation**: Launch web, fast-track mobile (Month 9-12)  
**Rationale**: Faster MVP, but mobile critical for scale

### Decision 3: Free Tier Depth
**Recommendation**: Generous free tier (full gameplay)  
**Rationale**: Lowers barrier, builds user base for network effects

### Decision 4: Pricing (‚Çπ99 vs ‚Çπ149 for Pro)
**Recommendation**: Start ‚Çπ149, A/B test ‚Çπ99  
**Rationale**: ‚Çπ149 = good value perception, room to discount

### Decision 5: Focus on India vs Early International
**Recommendation**: India-only Year 1-2  
**Rationale**: Nail one market before expanding

---

## Risks & Contingency Plans

### Risk 1: Mobile App Delays
**Impact**: Lose 60% of addressable market  
**Contingency**: 
- Invest in PWA (Progressive Web App) for offline support
- Partner with mobile dev agency (vs in-house)

### Risk 3: Regulatory Crackdown
**Impact**: Restricted marketing, age limits, potential ban  
**Contingency**:

- No real money prizes (stay non-gambling)
- Age verification mechanisms
- Diversify revenue (B2B, partnerships)

### Risk 4: Funded Competitor Launches
**Impact**: CAC inflation, feature parity pressure  
**Contingency**:
