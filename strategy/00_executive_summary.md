## Market Opportunity
India is the second-largest mobile gaming market globally and the world's largest cricket audience.

| Metric | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cricket fans | 500M+ | BARC/ICC estimates |
| Mobile gamers | 420M+ | KPMG 2025 |
| Fantasy sports users | ~150M | FIFS 2025 |
| Serviceable obtainable market (Year 1-3) | 50k - 250k users | Simulation-first cricket fans with spending propensity |
| Monetisable cohort (Year 3) | 20% paid conversion target | Based on management sim benchmarks |

**Timing Tailwinds**
1. Gaming regulation clarity improving - real-money gaming crackdown creates space for skill-based entertainment.
2. IPL, WPL, and bilateral cricket calendars keep attention high year-round.
3. Rising disposable income in Tier 1/2 cities and proven appetite for premium sports entertainment.

## Strategic Positioning

**Strengths**
- Clear white space in cricket management simulation; incumbents focus on arcade or fantasy formats.
- Differentiated ethics (no gambling, no loot boxes) aligned with regulatory expectations.
- Modular technology stack that enables rapid iteration and event-led content drops.

**Weaknesses**
- No mobile app at launch limits addressable base; PWA mitigation planned for Beta 2.
- Brand awareness is nascent; requires deliberate community seeding.
- Limited founding team bandwidth; must sequence GTM carefully to avoid dilution of effort.

**Opportunities**
- Partnerships with cricket educators, academies, and content creators seeking non-betting engagement.
- Fan appetite for long-form strategy experiences (Football Manager, F1 Manager) is visible but underserved in cricket.
- Domestic esports and watch-party formats offer amplification once core loop is validated.

**Threats**
- AAA cricket titles (EA Sports Cricket, WCC3) could add manager modes over time.
- Regulatory shifts could tighten advertising for games that resemble fantasy sports.
- Price sensitivity in India demands disciplined experimentation with offers and bundles.

## Monetisation Overview
SwitchedHit follows a freemium model with two paid tiers and cosmetic add-ons. Pricing is benchmarked against Indian spending power and comparable sports-management subscriptions.

| Tier | Monthly Price | Annual Price | Key Features |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Free - Rookie Manager | Rs 0 | N/A | Full core gameplay for one team, ad-supported |
| Starter - Club Manager | Rs 99 | Rs 999 (16% savings) | Quick simulations, analytics dashboards, private leagues, ad-free |
| Pro - Franchise Manager | Rs 299 | Rs 2,999 (16% savings) | Multi-team management, premium cosmetics, advanced training, concierge support |

**Supplementary Revenue:** Seasonal cosmetic packs (Rs 99 - 699), sponsored tournaments (post-traction), and future B2B analytics offerings. All monetisation is cosmetic or convenience-oriented to protect competitive integrity.

## Go-To-Market Highlights
- **Primary Objective (Year 1):** 25k registered users with 6% paid conversion supporting Rs 45 Lakhs in revenue.
- **GTM Budget (Year 1):** Rs 18 Lakhs with an organic-first allocation (content, community, creator barter) and paid experiments only after revenue traction.
- **Pre-Launch Focus (Q1 FY2026):** Closed beta with 300 testers, public waitlist, Discord activation, weekly dev diaries.
- **Launch Window (IPL 2026):** Organic content blitz, referral campaigns, creator barter collaborations; no paid media during first four months.
- **Post-Launch Optimisation:** Referral league, academy partnerships, tightly controlled paid tests (Rs 3 Lakhs cap) once CAC stays below Rs 250 and retention benchmarks hold.

## Key Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Potential Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mobile-first market adoption lag | Slower conversion and engagement | Deliver PWA support by Beta 2, schedule native app release with seed funding |
| Regulatory tightening for gaming | Marketing restrictions, compliance costs | Maintain non-betting positioning, secure legal advisory retainer, diversify channels |
| Influencer ROI variability | CAC spike, delayed traction | Blend micro and mid-tier creators, use performance-linked compensation, prioritise owned community content |
| Live-ops execution strain | Retention drop, negative sentiment | Hire community manager by launch, build automated event tooling, adopt quarterly content roadmap |

## Call to Action
