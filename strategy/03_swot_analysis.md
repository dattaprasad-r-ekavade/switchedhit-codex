## WEAKNESSES 🔻

### 1. **Limited Brand Recognition (New Entrant)**
- **Challenge**: Zero existing user base, no brand equity
- **Impact**: 
  - High initial CAC
  - Need to educate market about product
  - Difficult to compete with established gaming brands
- **Mitigation**: Influencer marketing, word-of-mouth, community building

### 2. **Single-Platform Initially (Web-Only)**
- **Gap**: No native mobile apps (iOS/Android) at launch
- **Impact**: 
  - India is mobile-first (420M mobile gamers vs ~200M desktop users)
  - User experience may be suboptimal on mobile browsers
  - Discovery challenges (not in Play Store/App Store)
  - Competitive disadvantage vs mobile-native games
- **Risk**: May miss significant user segment
- **Mitigation Plan**: Mobile app development in roadmap (post-launch)

### 3. **Small Team / Limited Resources**
- **Reality**: Likely 1-3 person founding team initially
- **Constraints**: 
  - Slow feature development
  - Limited customer support capacity
  - Can't compete on marketing spend with funded competitors
  - Bandwidth for partnerships/BD limited
- **Impact**: Slower growth, potential quality issues, burnout risk
- **Mitigation**: Prioritize ruthlessly, automate where possible, community self-support

### 4. **Unproven Simulation Algorithm**
- **Concern**: Match simulation quality/realism not yet validated at scale
- **Risks**: 
  - Users may find simulations unrealistic or predictable
  - Balance issues (batting too easy, bowling too hard)
  - Bugs in simulation logic could damage credibility
- **Impact**: Poor user experience → high churn
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Extensive beta testing
  - Community feedback loops
  - Continuous algorithm tuning

### 5. **Limited Content Variety Initially**
- **Launch State**: 
  - No official team licenses (IPL, international)
  - Generic player names, no real players
  - Limited cosmetic options at start
  - Single league format
- **Impact**: May feel "bare bones" compared to licensed games
- **User Perception**: Less immersive than games with official licenses
- **Mitigation**: Focus on gameplay depth, add content iteratively

### 6. **Dependency on Cricket Season Hype**
- **Risk**: User interest peaks during IPL, World Cup; drops during off-season
- **Challenge**: Maintaining engagement year-round
- **Impact**: Revenue volatility, seasonal churn
- **Mitigation**: 
  - User-generated tournaments (keep community active)
  - Seasonal events and themes
  - Gamification (daily rewards, streaks)

### 7. **No Offline Mode**
- **Limitation**: Requires internet connection (web-based)
- **India Context**: Internet penetration ~55%, inconsistent connectivity in Tier 2/3 cities
- **Impact**: Excludes portion of addressable market
- **Mitigation**: Progressive Web App (PWA) for offline basic functions, optimize for low bandwidth

### 8. **Monetisation Uncertainty**
- **Unknown**: Will Indian users pay for subscriptions + cosmetics?
- **Risk**: Conversion rates may be lower than projected (below 8-10%)
- **Cultural Factor**: India's gaming market still maturing for premium models
- **Impact**: Revenue shortfall, unit economics don't work
- **Mitigation**: Aggressive free trial, flexible pricing, localized offers
