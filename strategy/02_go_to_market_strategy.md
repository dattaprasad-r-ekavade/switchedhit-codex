## Risk Mitigation

### Market Risks

**Risk**: Low awareness in crowded gaming market
**Mitigation**: 
- Niche positioning (cricket simulation, not generic gaming)
- Hyper-targeted marketing to cricket fans
- Word-of-mouth through influencers

**Risk**: Seasonal interest (peaks during IPL, World Cup)
**Mitigation**:
- Year-round engagement through leagues and tournaments
- Content marketing during off-season (strategy guides, updates)
- User-generated tournaments keep community active

**Risk**: Competition from established games (Cricket 22, etc.)
**Mitigation**:
- Free-to-play accessibility
- Mobile-first, browser-based (no downloads)
- Focus on management, not arcade gameplay
- Community-driven features

### Execution Risks

**Risk**: Low conversion from free to paid
**Mitigation**:
- Aggressive first-month discounts
- 7-day free trial of Pro features
- Clear value demonstration (time saved, features unlocked)

**Risk**: High CAC, low ROI
**Mitigation**:
- Focus on organic channels initially
- Referral program to lower CAC
- Continuous A/B testing of ad creatives

**Risk**: Influencer campaigns underperform
**Mitigation**:
- Start with micro-influencers (lower cost, higher engagement)
- Performance-based contracts (affiliate model)
- Diversify across multiple creators
