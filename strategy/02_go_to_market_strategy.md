### Phase 0 - Validation (Jan-Mar 2026)
- Closed beta with 300 testers recruited through cricket forums and university clubs.
- Weekly live feedback calls; publish changelog blogs and behind-the-scenes videos.
- Hero KPIs: Day-7 retention above 35%, Rs 0 marketing CAC via organic sources.

### Phase 1 - Organic Launch (Apr-Aug 2026)
- Public waitlist opens; focus on content marketing (two blogs/week, three short-form videos/week).
- Launch Discord server with weekly AMAs, tactics clinics, and community polls.
- Creator barter program: 12 micro-influencers receive lifetime Starter access and early features in exchange for two review videos each.

### Phase 2 - Momentum Building (Sep-Dec 2026)
- Introduce referral league: teams earn Starter months for onboarding friends.
- Publish seasonal storylines (e.g., Ranji Trophy arcs) to sustain engagement.
- Pilot grassroots partnerships with two cricket academies (co-hosted tournaments, webinar workshops).
- Run targeted paid experiments capped at Rs 3 Lakhs (retargeting and boosts around major cricket fixtures); only continue if CAC < Rs 250 and Day-30 retention >22%.

### Phase 3 - Scale Readiness (Jan-Mar 2027)
- Package best-performing content into evergreen discovery funnels (YouTube playlists, email drip courses).
- Expand creator network to mid-tier partners using revenue-share deals funded through operating cash flows.

## Measurement Framework

- **Activation:** Tutorial completion, first match played, Starter offer conversion.
- **Engagement:** Day-7/30 retention, matches per week, Discord active members.

## Risk Management
- **Organic Plateau:** Mitigate via continuous content calendar, cross-posting, and creator collaborations; reserve paid spend to revive growth if organic plateaus.
- **Resource Strain:** Hire community manager before public launch; use volunteer moderators with clear incentives.
- **Creator Compliance:** Provide content briefs, shared asset libraries, and legal agreements covering disclosure requirements.
- **Budget Creep:** Quarterly finance reviews; any overspend requires leadership approval tied to revenue run rate.
- **Regulatory Changes:** Maintain compliance documentation, ensure marketing messaging avoids fantasy/gambling comparisons.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Finalise Q1 FY2026 content calendar and assign production owners.
2. Shortlist creator partners for barter pilot and issue collaboration agreements.
3. Launch community infrastructure (Discord, forum, knowledge base) ahead of public waitlist.
4. Build referral programme mechanics and analytics instrumentation for Phase 2 activation.
