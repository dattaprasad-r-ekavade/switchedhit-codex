## Key Assumptions
1. **Pricing:** Starter tier at Rs 99/month (Rs 999/year) and Pro tier at Rs 299/month (Rs 2,999/year) with 30% of paid users adopting annual plans by FY2028.

3. **Revenue Mix:** Subscriptions contribute 65% in FY2026, tapering to 66% by FY2028 as cosmetics and sponsorships scale.
4. **Retention:** Monthly paid churn improves from 7% in FY2026 to 4% in FY2028 through lifecycle marketing and pause options.
5. **Content & Live-Ops:** Quarterly cosmetic drops and seasonal tournaments drive cosmetic attachment (18% in FY2026 to 25% in FY2028).
6. **Headcount Growth:** Team expands from 12 FTEs in FY2026 to 24 FTEs in FY2028, with average fully-loaded cost of Rs 14 Lakhs per FTE.

## Sensitivity Analysis

### Conversion Rate
- If FY2026 conversion holds at 4% (instead of 6%), revenue declines to Rs 30 Lakhs, extending EBITDA breakeven by ~9 months and requiring an additional Rs 40 Lakhs bridge.
- If FY2027 conversion reaches only 8% (vs 9% base), revenue reduces to Rs 1.9 Crores and EBITDA margin slips to breakeven; mitigating actions include deeper referral incentives and enhanced Starter bundles.

### CAC
- A 20% CAC increase during paid experiments (Rs 300) raises FY2027 marketing spend to Rs 86 Lakhs and pushes payback to 105 days. Tightening audience targeting and expanding creator partnerships maintain efficiency.
- Achieving CAC of Rs 200 by FY2028 frees Rs 60 Lakhs for localisation and esports investment.

### ARPU
- If annual plan adoption plateaus at 20% in FY2028 (base 30%), blended ARPU drops to Rs 228 and revenue declines by Rs 90 Lakhs. Countermeasure: introduce exclusive annual cosmetics and loyalty rewards.

---

## Capital Requirements
- **Seed Raise:** Rs 1.8 Crores targeted in Q4 FY2026 to fund mobile acceleration, analytics, and initial paid experiments.
- **Contingency:** Maintain a 20% buffer (Rs 36 Lakhs) to absorb CAC volatility or regulatory-led delays.
- **Runway Target:** 18 months of operating runway, reaching EBITDA-positive operations by Q4 FY2027 under base assumptions.

---

## Reporting Cadence
- Monthly dashboards covering ARR, MRR, CAC, retention, and engagement.
- Quarterly board updates with scenario analysis, cash runway, and hiring progress.
- Annual reforecasts incorporating market feedback, regulatory guidance, and product roadmap shifts.

## Conclusion
SwitchedHit's financial outlook demonstrates a viable path from organic-led launch to scalable monetisation. The Rs 99 entry plan, combined with disciplined spending and diversified revenue streams, enables the company to prove product-market fit before committing significant capital to acquisition. By FY2028, the business is positioned to generate more than Rs 10 Crores in revenue with healthy margins and multiple levers for reinvestment.
