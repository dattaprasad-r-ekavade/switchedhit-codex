## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk | Description | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Price Dilution | Rs 99 starter price reduces revenue | Drive Starter volume through organic channels, promote annual upgrades, and grow Pro attachment |
| Cosmetic Fatigue | Users perceive cosmetics as low value | Rotate themes quarterly, include community-voted designs, highlight cosmetics in shared match highlights |
| Payment Drop-offs | High UPI/card failure rates | Offer wallet and Paytm integrations, send automated WhatsApp reminders, allow prepaid top-ups |
| Regulatory Change | Stricter rules on in-app monetisation | Maintain non-gambling positioning, keep compliance counsel on retainer, ensure transparent cancellation workflows |
| Organic Reach Limits | Slower growth without paid ads | Invest in community-led programs, creator barter partnerships, and consistent content cadence before scaling spend |

## Operating Requirements
- **People:** Monetisation lead (Q1 FY2026), lifecycle marketer (Q2), shared data analyst (Q3).
- **Technology:** Subscription engine layered on Razorpay, CRM (Customer.io), experimentation tooling (LaunchDarkly) for pricing tests.
