# Progress Report

## Summary
- Web app scaffolded with Next.js 13, Tailwind, and ShadCN UI; Prisma client wired for data access (`package.json:1`, `src/app/layout.tsx:1`, `src/lib/prisma.ts:1`).
- Database schema covers teams, players, matches, innings, and balls, with seed data for three IPL-style teams (`prisma/schema.prisma:9`, `prisma/seed.ts:5`).
- Read-only dashboards list teams, team details, and matches using server-side Prisma queries (`src/app/page.tsx:5`, `src/app/teams/page.tsx:6`, `src/app/teams/[id]/page.tsx:9`, `src/app/matches/page.tsx:6`).

## Functionality Status vs Project Description

| Project Description Requirement | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web & mobile-based multi-season league with promotion/relegation | Not started | Codebase only targets web; no league models or promotion/relegation logic present (`prisma/schema.prisma:9`). |
| User registration and login | Not started | No auth providers, user models, or routes exist within `src/app`. |
| Onboarding flow to pick team name/home ground and receive 15 auto-generated players | Not started | Team data is seeded manually (`prisma/seed.ts:5`); no UI or API to create teams or generate squads. |
| Manage playing XI, batting order, bowling lineup | Not started | Team detail page is read-only (`src/app/teams/[id]/page.tsx:9`) with no lineup management features. |
| Dynamic training sessions that boost player performance over time | Not started | No training session models, scheduling logic, or UI present in the repository. |
| Customizable home grounds with pitch advantages (spin/pace/flat) | Not started | `Team` model only stores a free-text `homeGround`; there are no pitch-type enums or related UI. |
| Automatic match scheduling at set times with simulated results display | Not started | Matches must be created manually (seed data only). Listing UI exists (`src/app/matches/page.tsx:6`), but no schedulers or result rendering, and no integration with the simulator. |
| Cricket simulation engine for result accuracy | Partial | A standalone simulator exists (`src/lib/simulation.ts:1`), but it is not invoked anywhere in the app or tied to persisted results. |
| Admin capabilities to create leagues, manage teams, configure lineups, test simulations, adjust parameters | Not started | Admin dashboard (`src/app/admin/page.tsx:5`) only links to stub routes; no forms, actions, or parameter controls implemented. |

## Existing Building Blocks
- Navigation component provides access to home, teams, matches, and admin areas (`src/components/navigation.tsx:1`).
- UI uses ShadCN cards/buttons for consistent presentation (`src/components/ui/button.tsx:1`, `src/components/ui/card.tsx:1`).
- Prisma logging enabled for query visibility during development (`src/lib/prisma.ts:7`).

## Gaps & Recommendations
- Prioritize implementing authentication and user onboarding to meet core user-facing requirements.
- Extend the Prisma schema to include leagues, seasons, training sessions, and pitch configurations before building corresponding UI.
- Wire the existing simulation engine into match workflows, persisting innings/ball data and displaying outcomes on the matches pages.
